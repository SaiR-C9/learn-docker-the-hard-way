=== Introduction

This section covers Docker basics. Enough to get you using Docker, and
understanding roughly its main features.


==== Assumptions

At this point I assume you have:

- a command line to work with
- installed docker
- installed most standard command-line tools
- set up an account on docker hub (https://hub.docker.com)

Make a note of your Docker hub details, as you wil need them later.

==== Check Docker installed

To check Docker is installed, run `docker version`.

The output should look like this:

----
$ docker version
Client:
 Version:      17.09.0-ce
 API version:  1.32
 Go version:   go1.8.3
 Git commit:   afdb6d4
 Built:        Tue Sep 26 22:40:09 2017
 OS/Arch:      darwin/amd64

Server:
 Version:      17.09.0-ce
 API version:  1.32 (minimum version 1.12)
 Go version:   go1.8.3
 Git commit:   afdb6d4
 Built:        Tue Sep 26 22:45:38 2017
 OS/Arch:      linux/amd64
 Experimental: true
----

If your version is 1.x (eg 1.12), then some features may not work as expected.
However, you should still be able to follow the course OK.
