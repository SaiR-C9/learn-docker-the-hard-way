The cache

RETURNING TO EXAMPLE IN 1)

----
mkdir -p ldthw_2.1
cd ldthw_2.1
cat > Dockerfile << END
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update -y
RUN apt-get install -y nginx
CMD bash
END
docker build -t secondimage .
----


That was quick. Because cache.

Using the cache:

----
RUN apt-get install -y nginx vim
----

vs

----
RUN apt-get install -y nginx
RUN apt-get install -y vim
----

Docker has no way of knowing if things have changed (eg a security fix for the nginx package).

In that case, force with --no-cache.
